On **June 10th, 2025**, four members of the NVSTly team traveled to **New York City** to attend the **2025 American Business Awards® ceremony**, held at the iconic **Marriott Marquis in Times Square**. It was an unforgettable night as we accepted the **Gold Stevie® Award for Tech Startup of the Year** — this time, **in person**.

While we [shared the exciting news back in April](https://nvstly.com/blog/NVSTly-Wins-Gold-Stevie-Award-723018) when the winners were announced, being there in person alongside other winners — **including eBay, AT&T, T-Mobile, HP Inc., and Fidelity Investments** — made the achievement feel even more surreal. To be honored alongside billion-dollar industry leaders was a proud and humbling moment for our startup and a huge milestone in NVSTly’s journey.

**During the event, our team was interviewed about the win. When asked:**  
*“What does winning a Stevie Award mean for your organization?”*  
*“How will winning a Stevie Award help your organization?”*
