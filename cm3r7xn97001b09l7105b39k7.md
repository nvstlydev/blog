### Real-Time Trade Notifications

Once a user follows a trader, they receive real-time notifications of their trades. This feature ensures that beginners can stay up-to-date with the latest moves of their chosen experts, enabling them to make informed decisions quickly. These notifications are crucial for those looking to copy trades or simply learn from the timing and choices of experienced traders. These notifications can also be setup so our Discord bot will DM these notification types to you, so you can never miss the opportunity of being notified of positions from traders you follow! You can modify notifications for each trader you follow, from the notification type, down to the market trade notifications you wish to receive.

### Automated Trade Sharing

To help traders expand their reach, NVSTly offers a [Trade Sharing](https://docs.nvstly.com/trade-sharing/trade-sharing-overview "NVSTly Help Center | Trade Sharing") feature that allows them to automatically share their trades across multiple Discord communities. By inputting Discord webhooks in their settings, traders can customize the message or embed content of the trade notifications sent to these webhooks. This feature enables traders to broadcast their trades in various Discord servers, increasing their visibility and influence in the trading community.

![NVSTly Trade Sharing Webhook Input](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732187862559/7136c7ac-d197-439a-b54e-a7efada741e2.png)

Submit as many Discord webhooks as you’d like. Trades will be sent to these webhooks and shared in the servers they are for. You can select which market trades to be shared to each webhook, the trading styles, and select which roles you want @mentioned or pinged when trades are sent to these webhooks.

![NVSTly Customize Message or Embed Trade Data Content](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732187864091/cba4ed74-4ae3-4898-beef-09cfe0995ff5.png)

You can **fully customize** how the message or embed looks that contains your trade signals or data. There are so many customizable options, or simply use our preset defaults.

### Integration with Social Media

NVSTly also plans to reintroduce integration with X (formerly Twitter) for the [Trade Sharing](https://docs.nvstly.com/trade-sharing/trade-sharing-overview "NVSTly Help Center | Trade Sharing") feature. Traders will be able to automatically share their trades, position updates, and more on X. This can be done either by using X API keys for full automation or by being prompted with an X New Post window to manually share the trade after it has been submitted to the NVSTly app. This feature ensures that traders can maintain a strong presence on social media, further enhancing their reach and credibility.

![NVSTly Customize X/Twitter Post for Trade Data Content](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732187865469/cd746668-e130-4ff0-a7bb-4028da7eb200.png)

Simply link your X/Twitter in Account Settings, once you submit a trade you will be prompted to post it on X manually. Or if you wish to fully automate the posting of your trades to X/Twitter, you will be able to do so by implementing your X API keys through settings. This was once a feature previously, but when Elon Musk took over Twitter they made breaking changes to their API, but we’re currently working on implementing this again now that we’re confident with their new API usage.

### Building Recognition and Following

For social traders, building a following and earning recognition is essential. NVSTly’s [global leaderboard](https://nvstly.com/ranks "NVSTly: Social Investing | Top Traders") provides a platform for traders to compete and showcase their skills. As traders climb the ranks, they gain visibility and attract followers, boosting their credibility and influence. This system not only rewards skill and consistency but also helps traders to establish themselves in the trading community.
