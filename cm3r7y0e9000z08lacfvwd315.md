Introducing [NVSTly](https://nvstly.com), the premier social trading platform where you can follow, learn from, and interact with top traders in real-time. Whether you’re new to trading or an experienced investor, NVSTly provides a suite of tools to enhance your trading journey. Here’s an in-depth look at what NVSTly offers:

### Trades Feed

The [Trades Feed](https://nvstly.com/trades "NVSTly: Latest Trades") is the heartbeat of NVSTly, showcasing all trades submitted by traders. Trades are displayed in real-time for premium users and with a 15-minute delay for free users. Each time a trade is opened, averaged, trimmed/partially closed, or exited, it gets refreshed to the top of this list.

Each trade entry displays:

*   The trader’s name
*   Ticker being traded (with direction: long/short)
*   Options data (if applicable)
*   Current status
*   Opening price
*   Profit/loss statistics

Trade Row

You can expand each row to view any notes from the trader. Additionally, users can give +Rep or leave comments directly on these trade rows.

### Submitting a New Trade

The New Trade interface is designed for submitting trades and modifying existing positions. This interface is your gateway to opening new trades, while the Active Positions tab lets you average, trim, partially close, or exit your open positions.

For a detailed guide, see [Submit Trades](https://docs.nvstly.com/submit-trades-from-web/submit-trades).

*   Average up/down
*   Trim positions
*   Close trades

*POV Charts show the candles when a trader has entered, averaged, trimmed, or closed*

### Leaderboards

The [Leaderboards](https://nvstly.com/ranks "NVSTly: Top Traders") rank the top traders across all markets based on a scoring system that includes:

*   Total number of closed trades
*   Win rate
*   Average return

Traders need a minimum of seven trades for ranking eligibility.

Leaderboard Ranks

*Help Tip:* The ranking formula may change to ensure fairness across different trading types.

### Server-Only Leaderboards

Discord servers have their own leaderboards, ranking traders within their community. These leaderboards require traders to have a minimum of seven trades (for timeframes above Past Day).

*Help Tip:* Access server-only leaderboards using:

*   `[https://trd.ng/ranks?guild=server-id-here](https://trd.ng/ranks?guild=server-id-here)`
*   `[https://nvstly.com/ranks?guild=server-id-here](https://nvstly.com/ranks?guild=server-id-here)`

### Dashboard

A trader’s Dashboard is a blend of their social profile and portfolio, displaying:

*   Latest trades
*   Trading performance stats
*   General info (join date, badges, reputation, bio)

### Stats

Dashboard stats reflect all closed trades over the past 30 days by default, with options to filter by different time ranges.

*First Set of Performance Stats*

*Help Tip:* Stats cannot be reset. We plan to add a feature for annual stat resets, with historical archives remaining publicly available.

### Reputation

+Rep is our community karma system, similar to likes or upvotes. It’s a key stat for identifying top traders and active users.

*Help Tip:* You can only +Rep another trader once per day to prevent abuse.

### Badges

*   Top Trader
*   High Win Rate

### Ticker Info

**Market Data Suite & Ticker Info user interfaces still under development**

Each stock and cryptocurrency ticker has its own interactive interface with:

*   Charts
*   Statistical data
*   Analytic graphs
*   News
*   Latest trades
