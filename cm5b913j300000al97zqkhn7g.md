# **Updates as They’re Finished**

Instead of waiting to bundle new features and fixes into big, infrequent releases, we push updates as they’re completed. This ensures users benefit from improvements as soon as possible. However, our agile development style means you might notice subtle changes before they’re officially included in a published changelog. These incremental updates allow us to iterate and enhance the platform quickly.

# **Internal Testing, Real-World Feedback**

Before any update reaches the production environment, our team conducts internal testing to ensure the new feature or fix works as intended. For example, a recent update to allow stats and daily/weekly recap commands to function with usernames containing spaces was thoroughly tested internally. Unfortunately, this change inadvertently broke compatibility with Discord IDs, highlighting the challenges of anticipating every edge case.

This is where building in public comes into play: while we strive for thorough testing, some issues only emerge when updates meet real-world usage. That’s why we rely on our vibrant user base to help us identify bugs, unintended behaviors, and areas for improvement.

# **The Role of Our User Community**

Our users play a critical role in the development process. By using [NVSTly](https://nvstly.com/) in their daily trading workflows, they encounter scenarios that internal testing might miss. When users report bugs, glitches, or other issues, it provides us with invaluable insights into how the platform performs under various conditions.

If you ever experience something on NVSTly that doesn’t seem to work as expected, we encourage you to report it to us. Unlike platforms that may identify and resolve issues passively over time, NVSTly relies directly on user feedback to detect and prioritize fixes. Every report helps us improve.

# **Changelogs: A Snapshot of Progress**

Given our frequent updates, we publish changelogs only after accumulating several changes or introducing major features. This means that when you see a changelog, many of the updates listed might have been implemented days or even weeks earlier. While this approach helps us focus on building and refining the platform, it’s another example of how building in public keeps the development process transparent.

# **Why Building in Public Matters**

By building in public, we:

* **Accelerate innovation:** Continuous updates ensure the platform evolves rapidly.
    
* **Foster transparency:** Users gain insight into what’s changing and how issues are addressed.
    
* **Strengthen collaboration:** Feedback from users directly informs our priorities and solutions.
    

This approach isn’t without its challenges, but we believe the benefits far outweigh the risks. Building in public allows us to create a platform that truly meets the needs of our community — a community we’re proud to involve in the journey.

# **How You Can Help**

If you notice a bug, glitch, or unintended behavior, please let us know right away. Your feedback is essential to making NVSTly better every day. Together, we’re not just building a platform; we’re building a community-driven experience that reflects the collective expertise and passion of its users.

Thank you for being part of the NVSTly journey. Let’s keep building — together.
