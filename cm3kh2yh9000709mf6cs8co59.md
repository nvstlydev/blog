We are thrilled to announce that [NVSTly](https://nvstly.com/), our innovative social investing platform, has been named a finalist in two categories at the highly anticipated [**Benzinga FinTech Awards 2024**](https://www.benzinga.com/fintech/24/10/41555938/fintechs-finest-benzinga-unveils-2024-global-fintech-awards-finalists): **Best Social Investing Platform** and the coveted **People’s Choice Award**.

We’re especially proud of our seamless integration with **Discord**, where our community can access real-time trade feeds, get live notifications, and manage their portfolios. It’s this dedication to innovation, transparency, and community building that has led us to become one of the fastest-growing social trading platforms.
