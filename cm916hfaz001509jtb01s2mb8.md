When it comes to social trading, there are plenty of platforms that claim to offer innovative ways to connect with other traders, share strategies, and improve your market performance. But let's be real: most so-called "social trading" apps are either glorified brokerage platforms with limited community features or outdated, clunky systems that donâ€™t offer real-time value.

Thereâ€™s really only *one* social trading app you need to considerâ€”NVSTly. Hereâ€™s why.
