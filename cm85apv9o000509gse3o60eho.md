In the fast-evolving world of investing, traders are constantly looking for ways to streamline their trading experience, share insights, and build transparency in the community.

## What is NVSTly's Brokerage Integration?

NVSTly's brokerage integration enables users to securely connect their brokerage accounts to the platform, allowing trades to be **automatically** recorded, tracked, and shared in real time. This means no more manual trade entries or missing crucial details—every trade is verified directly from the broker, ensuring authenticity.

Currently, NVSTly supports **Webull**, but we're actively working on adding support for **Charles Schwab (ThinkorSwim), Robinhood, Moomoo, TradeStation, and more**. As we expand, traders from multiple brokerages will be able to seamlessly integrate their accounts, making NVSTly the go-to platform for automated trade tracking and [social investing](https://nvstly.com).

2. **Automatic Trade Tracking** – Every trade executed in the linked brokerage account is automatically recorded on NVSTly, including trade details such as asset type, entry/exit price, time, and trade status.
    
3. **Real-Time Trade Sharing** – Users can choose to share trades instantly with their followers, to social media, or Discord.
    
4. **100% Accuracy & Verification** – Since all trades are pulled directly from the brokerage account, the data is **fully verified and cannot be altered**, ensuring **complete transparency**.
