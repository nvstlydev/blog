NVSTly: Social Investing

### A Community-Driven Approach to Trading

At its core, NVSTly offers a social network for traders, where they can share their trades and strategies across multiple markets, including **stocks**, **options**, and **cryptocurrencies**. With the recent addition of **forex** support, the platform now caters to an even broader range of traders. Users can follow top traders, track their performance, and even receive notifications in real-time as these traders make moves in the market.

One standout feature is the **Discord integration**. NVSTly has created a [unique Discord bot](https://nvstly.com/bot "NVSTly: Social Investing on Discord") that allows traders to interact with the platform directly through the popular chat service. Almost all functions available on the app, from submitting trades to viewing performance stats, can be done via Discord, making NVSTly highly accessible and user-friendly for those already entrenched in the Discord community.

### Detailed Insights and Performance Tracking

Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced trader, NVSTly’s **Trade Insight UI** offers an unmatched level of detail for every position you track. Every trade is meticulously logged, with a clear timeline of events, including when a position was opened, averaged, trimmed, or exited. This interface also features real-time asset data and a unique **POV Chart** that shows key trading moments directly on the candlestick chart, offering users a clear visual of trade performance.

In addition to individual trades, NVSTly provides **trader dashboards** that aggregate a user’s entire trading history. These dashboards include in-depth performance stats, such as win rate, average gain, highest winning trade, and more. Users can sort their stats by **market** or **trader type**, offering both beginners and veterans a powerful tool for measuring their success and identifying areas of improvement.

### Why NVSTly is Perfect for New Traders

For those just starting out in the world of trading, NVSTly offers a straightforward way to **learn from the best**. New traders can follow top-performing traders across the platform and receive **real-time notifications** of their trades, allowing them to study the strategies of more experienced market players. The platform’s [**global leaderboard**](https://nvstly.com/ranks "NVSTly: Social Investing | Top Traders") showcases the top traders by performance, with filters for different markets and trader types. This allows beginners to quickly identify which traders to follow based on their preferred asset classes or trading style.

The **free educational resources** offered by NVSTly are also a valuable addition. Through blog posts, market analysis, and community discussions, new traders can deepen their understanding of the financial markets and gain confidence as they develop their own trading strategies.

### Empowering the Social Trader

Experienced traders, or those more familiar with social trading, will find NVSTly to be a **powerful tool for showcasing their skills**. The platform’s **trade sharing** functionality allows traders to broadcast their moves in real-time to a global audience, gaining recognition and potentially building a following. The **global leaderboard** not only highlights top traders but also provides a sense of prestige, especially for those looking to validate their strategies in a public arena.

NVSTly’s integration with **brokerage accounts** means traders can automate the tracking and sharing of their trades, with many brokers already supported, including **Webull** (currently in beta testing). This optional feature is a game-changer for traders who want to focus on trading without having to manually update their NVSTly account. For those who prefer a more hands-on approach, trades can still be manually submitted through the app or the Discord bot.

Another exciting feature on the horizon is **1-click copy trading**, which will allow users to instantly replicate the trades of top traders. This will provide a seamless way for both new and veteran traders to benefit from the expertise of NVSTly’s best performers, all without manually entering trades in their own brokerage accounts.

### Real-Time Market Data and Validation

One of NVSTly’s strongest features is its commitment to **real-time market data** validation. When traders submit their trades, the platform automatically checks the current market data to ensure the trades are legitimate and were executed in real-time. This helps maintain the integrity of the community and prevents fraudulent behavior, making NVSTly a trustworthy platform for social trading.

The app is not involved in actual buying or selling of assets, but it does provide robust tools to **track and share** trades across markets. This distinction ensures that traders can confidently share their portfolios without being tied to real market transactions, a feature that appeals to both hobbyists and seasoned investors alike.

### A Platform That Grows With You

NVSTly is more than just a tool for tracking trades — it’s a **community of traders** who are passionate about learning, sharing, and improving their craft. Whether you’re a day one beginner or a seasoned veteran, NVSTly offers a platform that **adapts to your needs**. With its seamless user experience, broad market support, and in-depth performance tracking, NVSTly has established itself as a **must-have tool for modern traders**.
