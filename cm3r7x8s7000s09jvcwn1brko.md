From February 7th, 2024

NVSTly v2.0 is here!

It’s official. Version 2.0 is complete now equipped with mobile apps on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ly.nvst.android "NVSTly on Google Play") and [Apple’s App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nvstly-social-investing/id6475617649 "NVSTly on iOS")! V2.0 UI/UX has been out for a some months while we’ve been building in public, and although there is still much more work to complete and features we want to implement, we’re officially in the 2nd version of this platform. Available on web, mobile, and full Discord integration, investors can track, share, or copy trades with in-depth performance stats and extensive insights on every position. To celebrate this we’re hosting a giveaway in our [Discord community](https://nvstly.com/go/discord "NVSTly Discord Server"), more info on that below. We’re also launching on Product Hunt for the second time to showcase the all-new interactive design v2.0 has provided.
