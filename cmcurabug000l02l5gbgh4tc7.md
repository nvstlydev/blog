## ✅ Automate Your Signal Sharing Across Platforms

**Signal delivery shouldn't be a manual hassle.** NVSTly gives you multiple ways to track and share your trading signals—whether you’re active on **Discord**, using **our app**, or trading directly through your broker.

### 🟢 For Discord-Based Signal Providers

Our **NVSTly Discord Bot** was built with signal providers in mind. Once installed in your server, it can **automatically detect, track, and publish your trade signals in real-time**. Just type your trades or use the built-in commands, and the bot handles the rest:

* Auto-logs the trade to your NVSTly profile
    
* Updates your trade’s status as it progresses (e.g., average, partial, closed)
    
* Instantly notifies your followers
    
* Can also automatically share these [tracked signals](https://nvstly.com/trades) to other Discord servers & trading communities using webhook
    

### 📱 For Web & Mobile Users

Not on Discord? No problem. NVSTly’s **web and mobile apps** make it easy to manually input your trades. Whether you’re on the go or managing a premium signals channel elsewhere, you can:

* Enter trade details quickly
    
* Update prices and close trades at any time
    
* Keep your followers informed without delay
    

Install the NVSTly mobile app on [iOS App Store](https://nvstly.com/go/ios) or [Google Play](https://nvstly.com/go/android) for Android

### 🔗 Brokerage Integration = Full Automation

For the most seamless experience, NVSTly offers **brokerage integrations** (e.g., Webull) that allow your trades to be **fully automated**. Once connected:

* Your trades are tracked the moment they’re executed
    
* Followers get real-time notifications of your activity
    
* You no longer need to lift a finger to share a signal
    

This is perfect for high-volume traders or signal providers managing multiple accounts.
