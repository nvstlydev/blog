# **Building Momentum in 2025 🚀**

This achievement comes on the heels of **winning Gold for Tech Startup of the Year at the** [**2025 American Business Awards**](https://stevieawards.com/aba/company-organization-awards-1) in June, where our team proudly accepted the honor in New York City.

It also follows the fantastic news that **Corey “**[**JustCoreGames**](https://nvstly.com/trader/justcoregames)**” Berdini**, one of NVSTly’s key team members, earned a **Silver Stevie for Employee of the Year** in the *Information Technology — Social Media* category at the [**2025 Stevie Awards for Technology Excellence**](https://stevies-tech.secure-platform.com/site/page/the-awards/2025-stevie-winners). Corey’s dedication, creativity, and impact on the NVSTly community make this recognition well deserved.

# **A Growing Track Record of Recognition 🏅**

Our recent wins join last year’s milestone when NVSTly took home the **People’s Choice Award** at the [**2024 Benzinga Fintech Deal Day & Awards**](https://nvstly.com/shrt/bnzgaward). We’re looking forward to being nominated again at this year’s Benzinga Fintech Awards and continuing to share our journey with the fintech community.

# **The Lisbon Ceremony — Watching from Afar ✈️**

The **International Business Awards** ceremony will be held on **October 10, 2025, in Lisbon, Portugal**. As a small, bootstrapped startup, we don’t have the luxury of flying our team across the world to attend in person, but we’ll be celebrating from home, cheering on fellow winners and honoring the incredible innovation showcased by all nominees.
