Unlike other apps in the market, NVSTly is not just about trading but about creating a comprehensive and engaging social investing ecosystem. Here’s an in-depth look at why NVSTly stands out as the best social investing app available today.

### Completely Free to Use

One of the most compelling aspects of NVSTly is its commitment to accessibility. Unlike many other social investing platforms that impose subscription fees or hide essential features behind a paywall, NVSTly is completely free to use. This approach democratizes access to powerful trading tools and insights, making it possible for everyone — from novice investors to seasoned traders — to benefit from the platform’s offerings without financial barriers.

### Multi-Platform Availability

NVSTly understands that investors need flexibility in how they access their trading platforms. That’s why it is available both on the web and on mobile devices ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ly.nvst.android "NVSTly: Social Investing on Google Play") and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nvstly-social-investing/id6475617649 "NVSTly: Social Investing on Apple App Store")).

### Unique Discord Integration

In a first-of-its-kind feature, NVSTly offers full integration with Discord through a [unique bot](https://discord.com/application-directory/901245095502819358 "NVSTly Discord App").

The bot enables users to track, share, and discuss trades in real-time, fostering a vibrant community of traders. This seamless integration with Discord is a game-changer, offering unmatched convenience and engagement for users who are active on this popular communication platform.

### Real-Time Trade Tracking and Insights

NVSTly excels in providing real-time tracking and insights for trades. Users can track, share, or copy trades with extensive insights on every position.

The unique POV Chart marks the candlesticks on when the trader took actions, offering a clear and comprehensive view of trading strategies.

### Comprehensive Market Support
